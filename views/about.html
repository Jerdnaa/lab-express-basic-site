    <h1>SHREK</h1>
    <p class="aboutShrek">
      Shrek is a 2001 American computer-animated fantasy comedy film loosely
      based on the 1990 children's picture book of the same name by William
      Steig. Directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson (in their feature
      directorial debuts) and written by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Joe
      Stillman, and Roger S. H. Schulman, it is the first installment in the
      Shrek film series. The film stars Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz,
      and John Lithgow. In the film, an embittered ogre named Shrek (Myers)
      finds his home in the swamp overrun by fairy tale creatures banished by
      the obsessive ruler Lord Farquaad (Lithgow). With the help of Donkey
      (Murphy), Shrek makes a pact with Farquaad to rescue Princess Fiona (Diaz)
      in exchange for regaining control of his swamp.
